## Launch the FitNesse server

Go to the `FitNesse` directory and start the FitNesse server on a port of your choice (here: 7777).

- `cd FitNesse`
- `java -jar fitnesse-standalone.jar -p 7777` 

Open a browser and go to the running FitNesse server. (Make sure to use the same port as in the previous step!)

- `http://localhost:7777`

You should now see a webpage with the message "Welcome to FitNesse!", among other things.
