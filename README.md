# Specification by Example - Code

This repository contains the code skeleton that we will use in my Specification by Example-Workshop.
It also contains an example solution, so you can refer to that if you get lost or fall behind.

In general, trying to solve this on your own without looking at the solution will give you better learning results!


## Launch the FitNesse server

Go to the `FitNesse` directory and start the FitNesse server on a port of your choice (here: 7777).

- `cd FitNesse`
- `java -jar fitnesse-standalone.jar -p 7777` 

Open a browser and go to the running FitNesse server. (Make sure to use the same port as in the previous step!)

- `http://localhost:7777`

You should now see a webpage with the message "Welcome to FitNesse!", among other things.
